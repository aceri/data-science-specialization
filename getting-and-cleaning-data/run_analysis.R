# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
#

# =========================================================================
# 1 / Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# =========================================================================
#       - what training data ?
#           - 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
#           - 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
#       - what test sets data?
#           - 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
#           - 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.	
#       - how can we merge them?
#           - 'train/y_train.txt' and 'test/y_test.txt': labels. - numbers from 1 to 6 ??	
#           - both y and x_train have 7352 
#           - both y and x_test have 2947
#           * So we should be able to join x and y as columns from x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test into xmerged, ymerged

            x_train<-read.table("train/x_train.txt",header=FALSE)
            y_train<-read.table("train/y_train.txt",header=FALSE)
            x_test<-read.table("test/x_test.txt",header=FALSE)
            y_test<-read.table("test/y_test.txt",header=FALSE)
            xmerged<-rbind(x_train,x_test)
            ymerged<-rbind(y_train,y_test)

#       - Now we add the names of the columns (features)
            
            feature_names<-read.table("features.txt",header=FALSE)
            feature_names<-feature_names[,2]  # we only want the second column
            # we modify xmerged column names with the feature_names
            names(xmerged)<-feature_names
            
# =========================================================================
# 2 / Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# =========================================================================

            filtered_merge <- xmerged[,only_mean_std]

# =========================================================================            
# 3 / Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# =========================================================================

            # Now seems this question refers to y data having numbers from 1 to 6
            
            # Where do we get the activity names? -> activity_labels.txt so we import them
            
            y_labels <- read.table("activity_labels.txt",header=FALSE)

            #     mean -> Mean

            #     Removing those BodyBody repetitions and the "-" and the "()"
